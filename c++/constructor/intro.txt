/*
ðŸ”¹ What is a Constructor in C++?
A constructor is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created.

It is mainly used to:
    ->Initialize the data members of a class.
    ->Allocate resources if needed when an object is created

ðŸ”¹ Syntax of Constructor:
    class ClassName {
public:
    ClassName() {
        // Constructor body
    }
};
The constructor name must be the same as the class name and it has no return type (not even void).


ðŸ”¹ Types of Constructors in C++

There are three main types of constructors:
    i)Default Constructor
    ii)Parameterized Constructor
    iii)Copy Constructor
